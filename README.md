# Astro + Conform

Enhances the form described in the [Conform tutorial](https://conform.guide/tutorial) inside Astro.

The dehydrated form makes document requests to `/src/pages/index.astro`. The hydrated form makes fetch requests to the API route defined in `/src/pages/messages.ts`. The endpoints share validation and app logic defined in `/src/utils/shared.ts`.
